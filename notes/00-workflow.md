Your Workflow Going Forward

Now you have a perfect, repeatable workflow:

Add a New Problem:
Add the CREATE TABLE statement to 01-schema.sql.
Add the INSERT statements to 02-data.sql.
Create a new .md file in your notes folder with the pattern breakdown.

Test Locally:
Destroy your old container: docker-compose down -v
Create a fresh one with the new tables: docker-compose up -d
Solve the problem in your SQL client.

Save to GitHub:
git add .
git commit -m "Added the 'Compare a Row to Itself' pattern"
git push

NEXT STEPS:

Solidify the Schema & Data: You're absolutely right, the current setup is the bare minimum. Enhancing it is a great idea. For the tweets table, this could mean:

Adding a PRIMARY KEY to tweet_id to ensure it's always unique.

Making certain columns NOT NULL.

Choosing more precise data types if needed.

This step turns it from a quick example into a proper, well-defined table, which is excellent practice.

Document in Markdown: This is the core of the learning process. Your .md file for the "Histogram" pattern should be your single source of truth. It should contain:

The full question from DataLemur.
The table schema.
The sample data.
The expected output.
A step-by-step breakdown of the pattern (the inner summary, then the outer summary).
The final, commented SQL solution.

Add the Next Question: 

When you're ready for the next pattern, you'll follow the simple, repeatable loop you've built:

Append the new CREATE TABLE statement to 01-schema.sql.
Append the new INSERT statements to 02-data.sql.
Create a brand new .md file for the new pattern.
Run your reset command: docker-compose down -v followed by docker-compose up -d.
Solve, document, and learn.
Commit your progress to GitHub.
